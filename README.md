## Course Overview Summary

### Section 1: Software Development Processes and Methodologies

- **Requirements Foundations:** Explored why requirements are the blueprint for success and the bridge between stakeholders and developers.
- **Requirements vs. Specifications:** Distinguished between user-centric "What/Why" (Requirements) and developer-centric "How/Technical What" (Specifications).
- **NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements):** Learned how "Quality Attributes" (performance, security, scalability) define the success of a product beyond just its features.
- **WRSPM Model & Success Equation:** Studied the formal framework connecting the World, Requirements, Specifications, Program, and Machine, and the equation ($W, M, P \vdash R$) that defines a successful software solution.
